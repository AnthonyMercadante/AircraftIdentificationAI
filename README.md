# Aircraft Identifier AI: WWII to Modern Era

## Introduction
Welcome to the Aircraft Identifier AI project repository! This project, led by Nam, Nishkarsh, Adam, and Anthony, develops an AI model to identify aircraft in photographs. It's a collaboration with the National Air Force Museum of Canada, inspired by WWII RAF's training methods.

## Project Background
During WWII, the RAF used aircraft silhouette playing cards for training. We're modernizing this concept with AI, aiding the museum's digitization effort and enhancing public research capabilities.

## Current Challenge
The museum is digitizing its aircraft photo archive, but current search methods are limited and manual. Our AI aims to automate and improve this process.

## Project Goals
- Develop an AI model to identify aircraft types in photos.
- Focus on accurate plane detection, progressing to specific identifications.
- Stretch goal: Extract textual information like aircraft numbers from photos.

## Research Focus
We're exploring the number of labeled examples needed for effective training, considering various aircraft angles and perspectives. A key goal is to reduce processing time and enhance accuracy.
